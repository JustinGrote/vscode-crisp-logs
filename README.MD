# Crisp Logs

![Logo](logo.png)

Crisp Logs provides a better default log highlighting experience. Multiple additional tokens are provided to further allow you to customize logs as you see fit.

The included colors are optimized for the Default Dark+ theme, however the individual highlighting tokens are fully customizable to whatever preferred colors you want.

# Development

This uses several rules inspired by the Log File Highlighter extension, but using a YAML template format used by the Typescript TextMate syntax, which has a build script for variables and de-duplication
